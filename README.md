# OpenHardwareAGV
Repository for our Final Degree Project, if possible we'll try to help it become a real Open Source project

# What is this exactly?

A Open Source Hardware (OSH) repository for an Autmated Guided Vehicle (AGV), a mobile robot used in factories mostly to carry things. This is intented to be a modular framework which may allow to build many different and configurable vechiles depending on its purpose, thus gaining an edge above closed source vehicles. All the information so far has been gathered in the report for the project in the most explainatory way we could, hope you find it useful.

# What we've done so far (what you can find in the report):
- Defined and limited a specific used for AGV: towing AGV which can work as underride.
- Display the components and basics of AGV building
- Chose and applied an OSH method (Oberloier and Pearce)
- Developed and studied choosing methods for battery, motors, mechanics, sensors, and more superficially, processsing hardware and software
- Worked on how to get the vehicle through the industrial standard (ISO 3691-4:2020)
- CAD models of the frame and bodywork, tested with Finite Element Analysis.

# What we want to accomplish
- Building a real model
- Testing
- Passing the standard
- Programming
- Do a decent github <:
